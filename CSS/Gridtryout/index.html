                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
                learning from their
                experiences was easy.

                "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which find really refreshing. The program gave me
                the confidence
                necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
                standard is above the
                rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
                people."

                "Before joining the bootcamp. Tve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help
                me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to anroll by a former student of theirs who can only
                say wonderful
                things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoit. They were very hands-on and
                never had to
                wait long for assistance. The agile team project, In particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
                the next level
                in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during Interviews as an
                example of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land. a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers 100%
                recommend!"
